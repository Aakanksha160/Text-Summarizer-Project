# End-to-End Text Summarizer

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end text summarizer built using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The summarizer is capable of condensing long articles, documents, or any other form of text into concise summaries while retaining key information. This project provides a flexible and customizable framework to update configurations, parameters, and components, making it easy to adapt to various use cases.

The text summarizer uses a modular pipeline, allowing you to adjust the configuration, parameters, and components to suit your needs. The project includes detailed configuration files and a pipeline for processing and summarizing text in an efficient and scalable manner.

## Features
- **Configurable Summarization**: Easily update configuration and parameters for summarization.
- **Modular Pipeline**: A flexible pipeline structure that can be customized with new components.
- **Easy Integration**: Use the summarizer in different applications by updating the configuration files and pipeline.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the summarizer logic and pipeline.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For text summarization tasks.
- **YAML**: For configuration and parameter management.
- **Flask**: For serving the summarizer as a web application (if applicable).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Aakanksha160/Text-Summarizer-Project.git
   cd End-to-End-Text-Summarizer

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Update configuration files:

- config.yaml: Update this file to configure the summarizer settings.
- params.yaml: Set the necessary parameters for the summarization process.
- entity: Update the entities as per the use case.

4. Modify components and pipeline:

- Update the src/config for configuration management.
- Adjust the pipeline components as required in the pipeline.py file.
- Modify the main application logic in main.py and app.py.

5. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```
### How to Use
- Once the application is running, you can interact with the summarizer via the web interface or through an API (depending on your implementation).
- Upload a document or input a block of text to receive a summarized version of the content.
